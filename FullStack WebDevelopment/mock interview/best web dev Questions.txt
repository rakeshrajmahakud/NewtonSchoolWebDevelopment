Difference between async and defeer ?
///Asynchronous///                                                                                                   ///Deferred///
Asynchronous blocks the parsing of the page.	                                                          Deferred never block the page.
Asynchronous scripts don’t wait for each other.
So if a smaller script is second in the order, 
it will be loaded before the previous longer one.	                                                   Deferred scripts maintain their relative order which means the first script will be loaded first while all other below it will have to wait.
The execution of scripts begins by pause parsing.	                                                   However, the execution of scripts begins only after parsing is completely finished but before the documents’s DOMContentLoadedevent.

Collapsing white spaces decreases the transmission time between the server and the client because collapsing features remove unnecessary bytes that are occupied by the white spaces. By mistake, if you leave extra white space, the browser will ignore it and display the UI perfectly

Responsive vs Adaptive Website Design ?
Put simply, responsive is fluid and adapts to the size of the screen no matter what the target xdevice. Responsive uses CSS media queries to change styles based on the target device such as display type, width, height, etc., and only one of these is necessary for the responsive website to adapt to different screen sizes.

Adaptive design, on the other hand, uses static layouts based on breakpoints that don’t respond once they’re initially loaded.

The web storage is more secure and large amounts of data can be stored locally on the client-side web browser. All the data is stored in key-value pairs. 

In HTML5 there are two types of web storage API.

localStorage
SessionStorage
localStorage: It is used to store data on the client-side. It has no expiration time, so the data in the LocalStorage exists always till the user manually deletes it.
Syntax:
For storing data in web storage: The key and value both should be string or number;

how do i restore the default value of a property?

Some special characters are reserved for use in HTML, meaning that your browser will parse them as HTML code. For example, if you use the less-than (<) sign, the browser interprets any text that follows as a tag.
To display these characters as text, replace them with their corresponding character entities, as shown in the following table.

&	&amp;	Interpreted as the beginning of an entity or character reference.

what is don't break the web ?

the idea is that any new web technology that is introduced should be backwards compatible
with what went before it (i.e. old web sites will still continue to work), and forwards
compatible (future technologies in turn will be compatible with what we currently have).
As you go through the learning material presented here, you'll start to learn how this 
is made possible with some very clever design and implementation work.

what is world wide web ?

The World Wide Web (WWW) is combination of all resources and users on the Internet that
are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Who manages the World Wide Web?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations,
a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards.
Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe,
W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.

what happen if we miss docktype ?

The browser enters Quirks mode and tries to deal with your code as if it was written in the late 90’s.
This means they will imitate many bugs that existed in the old browsers.
It is not consistent on how to do this (so you will get significantly different results,for example,
from Firefox to Internet Explorer). The purpose of DOCTYPE is to tell the browser what type of HTML you are writing.
It is not valid to omit the DOCTYPE. There is no “Standard” format. The browser will just try to parse HTML as best it can.
But not all elements will be displayed correctly. DOCTYPE is a required part of all HTML documents.
In HTML5 the tag used is: <! DOCTYPE html>

What are the different types of DNS server?
All DNS servers fall into one of four categories: Recursive resolvers, root nameservers, TLD nameservers,
and authoritative nameservers. In a typical DNS lookup (when there is no caching in play),
these four DNS servers work together in harmony to complete the task of delivering the IP address for a 
specified domain to the client (the client is usually a stub resolver - a simple resolver built into an operating system).

what are pseudo elements and classes ?
Pseudo-Class
A pseudo-class represents a state of a selector like :hover, :active, :last-child,etc. These start with a single colon(:).
The syntax of CSS pseudo-class is as follows −

:pseudo-class{
   attribute: /*value*/
}

Pseudo-Element
Similarly, a pseudo-element is used to select virtual elements like ::after, ::before, ::first-line, etc.
These start with a double colon(::).
The syntax of CSS pseudo-element is as follows −

::pseudo-element{
   attribute: /*value*/
}

difference between margin and padding ?

the vw (view-width) and vh (view-height) units are relational to the view-port size, where 100vw or vh is 100% of the view-port's width/height. For example, 
if a view-port is 1600px wide,and you specify something as being 2vw, that will be the equivalent of 2% of the view-port width, or 32px.

what are the units in html ? 
absolute units
points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in) 
px: pixels
cm:centemeter
in:inch
pc:picas(1pc = 12 pt) 
Relative Units
EM: Relative to the parent element
REM: Relative to the root element (HTML tag)
%: Relative to the parent element
VW: Relative to the viewport’s width
VH: Relative to the viewport’s height
While PX, EM, and REM are primarily used for font sizing, %, VW, and VH are mostly used for margins, padding, spacing, and widths/heights.

what is onload in html ?
In JavaScript, this event can apply to launch a particular function when the page is fully loaded.
It can also be used to verify the type and version of the visitor's browser. We can check what cookies a page uses by using the onload attribute.
In HTML, the onload attribute fires when an object has been loaded. The purpose of this attribute is to execute a script when the associated element loads.
In HTML, the onload attribute is generally used with the <body> element to execute a script once the content (including CSS files, images, scripts, etc.)
of the webpage is completely loaded. It is not necessary to use it only with <body> tag, as it can be used with other HTML elements.

what is window object ?
The window object represents an open window in a browser. If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), 
the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.


what is DOM ?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure
wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure,
style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

what is CSSOM ?
The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML.
It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically. The values of CSS are represented untyped, that is using String objects.

what is hoisting in javascript ?
In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, 
it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local. 
It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code. 
Note: JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initializations.
JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions defined in the program before execution.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

WHAT IS HOISTING ? ONE LINE ANS ?
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.

what is meter tag in html ?
The <meter> tag defines a scalar measurement within a known range, or a fractional value. This is also known as a gauge.

what is a sementic tag in html ?

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage?
For most cases, we use the localStorage object if we want some data to be on the browser.
If we want it on the server, then we use cookies, and the sessionStorage is used when we want to destroy the data whenever that specific tab gets closed or the season is closed by the user.
>>The main features of localStorage are:
Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.
>>The main features of localStorage are:
The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.
Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.
>>Both storage objects provide same methods and properties:
setItem(key, value) – store key/value pair.
getItem(key) – get the value by key.
removeItem(key) – remove the key with its value.
clear() – delete everything.
key(index) – get the key on a given position.
length – the number of stored items.

the size of the local session and coosies ?
The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB	
The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB	
The storage capacity of Cookies is 4KB

What is ARIA?
ARIA is shorthand for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT). When accessibility issues cannot be managed with native HTML, ARIA can help bridge those gaps.

Types of selectors in css ?
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
*Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
*Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
*Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
*Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
*Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Map vs for each ?
The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything. You can use the forEach method to mutate the source array, but this isn't really the way it's meant to be used.

What is HTML dom ?
The HTML DOM is an Object Model for HTML. It defines:
HTML elements as objects
Properties for all HTML elements
Methods for all HTML elements
Events for all HTML elements

JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML elements
JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML attributes
JavaScript can add/change/remove CSS styles
JavaScript can react to HTML events
JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML events
The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

### Display none vs visibility  hidden ?
- Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there:
visibility:hidden; also hides an element.
However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:


### DISAPPEARING OF WWW ?

Progressively, given that “http://” was always added in front or URLs typed in the browsers,
and because treatment of“www” was correclty done,the use of “www” became less and less necessary and thus popular as part of URL.
Developpers slowly became conscious of the possibility to give URL of their work without the “www” part,and webusers themselves,
seing more and more of those websites without www, became conscious that they could skip it,
helped by their natural lazyness wich was fortunately harmonized with the whole logic.
