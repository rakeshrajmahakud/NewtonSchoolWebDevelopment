    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>hi , there is a small story behind it ,
        when i was in class 4 at that time all of my love towards electronics items
         so when i see an old radio or old battery i was happy because i want to use 
         it for run a sll led light ,gradually i grew up and when i was class 8 my fater
         brought a pc and i was always love to play games and open its cabinet to see whats 
         inside it so i learn how things actually work and gradually know that how a software
         industry run the world .and for making Iot devices to work so we need to know coding so
