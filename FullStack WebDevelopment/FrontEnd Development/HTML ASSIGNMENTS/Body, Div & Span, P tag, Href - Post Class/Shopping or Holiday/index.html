<!-- Shopping or Holiday?
Lists are used very extensively to organize information. They can be ordered and un-ordereded. Let's make some of our own using HTML lists.

Imagine you got a job from Newton School. Make 2 lists identifying the use of the money you'll make from the job
Acceptance Criteria
- The first list should be an ordered list of 3 items that you'd like to buy with your salary.
- This list should have data-ns-test attribute in the <li> element and value of the attribute should be "shoppingList"
- The second list should be an unordered list of the holiday destinations that you'd like to visit after you got a job.
- It should at least have 3 places. This list should have data-ns-test attribute in the <li> element and value of the attribute should be "holidayList"
